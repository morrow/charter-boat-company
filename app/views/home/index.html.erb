    The Sundowner and Sundowner II sail from Orient by the Sea Marina at Orient Point.  This location provides quick access to the sheltered waters of Long Island Sound, Peconic Bay, Gardiners Bay, and is only a short run to Montauk Point. The marina has an excellent restaurant and bar serving lunch and dinner.

    Long Island's North Fork is famous for its rural character and laid back style. Its roads are still relatively free of the traffic that's become so common on other parts of the island. If you're planning on staying for more than one day look at www.NorthForkGuide.com for information on lodging and local attractions.
